"In this report, we examine the available evidence regarding ICT's current and projected climate impacts. We examine peer-reviewed studies which estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be 1.8-2.8% of global GHG emissions. Our findings indicate that published estimates all underestimate the carbon footprint of ICT, possibly by as much as 25%, by failing to account for all of ICT's supply chains and full lifecycle (i.e. emissions scopes 1, 2 and fully inclusive 3). Adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we estimate that ICT's share of emissions could actually be as high as 2.1-3.9%. "

"A hugely optimistic scenario - which takes into account 20% annual improvement of the J/bit in data centers
and networks until 2030 is presented. However, the electric power consumption of the present ICT scope will
be significant unless great efforts are put into power saving features enabling such improvements of J/bit.
Despite evident risks, it seems though that planned power saving measures and innovation will be able to
keep the electricity consumption of ICT and the World under some kind of control. The major conclusion is
based on several simulations in the present study - that future consumer ICT infrastructure cannot slow its
overall electricity use until 2030 and it will use more than today. Data traffic may not be the best proxy metric
for estimating computing electricity. Operations and J/operation seem more promising for forecasting and
scaling of bottom-up models."

Overall, energy consumption rises due to ICT.
ICT decreases energy demand via energy efficiency and sectoral change.
ICT increases energy demand via a growing ICT sector, rebounds and economic growth.
Digitalization does not decouple economic growth from energy consumption.
Insights from debates on decoupling can explain these relationships.
